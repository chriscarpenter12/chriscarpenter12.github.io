It is hard to concentrate on growing your company and stay competitive in the current IT business when you are always trying to fix, patch or update your infrastructure by yourself.

Whether you need a complete website, small updates, a client facing portal or internal application we can write it for you. Keeping up with the latest and greatest web development standards is hard, but we take that pain away for you. With modern day tools and advancements, with languages like JavaScript, building complex applications is a reality for any company now.</p>

</ul>
<p>Our development is not strictly tied to the web either. We can build APIs for internal or external applications, provide data processing, and migration between databases or other systems. Depending on your needs,  we can work on mobile applications that can be published on the App Store or Google Play Store.</p>

  <h2>Email</h2>
  <p><strong>Email is a simple service that you rely on for your business communication.</strong></p>
<p>Even in todays fast paced instant communication platforms email is a requirement to running your business. It hasn't changed much in the last few decades yet it still takes some experience to keeping your mail system running efficiently. We have experience managing many different email systems. Whether you want to run in the cloud with (link: https://gsuite.google.com text: Google) and (link: https://products.office.com/en-us/business/office-365-business text: Microsoft). Or locally with (link: https://products.office.com/en-us/exchange/email text: Exchange) or a simple (link: http://www.postfix.org text: Postfix)/(link: https://www.dovecot.org text: Dovecot) installation we can install and maintain your email systems. We also can help you setup a mass email marketing campaign if you intend to send newsletters to your customers. With analytics built in you can see how effective your campaigns are working.</p>
<p>We can take care of all the legwork of configuring the proper DNS settings for your MX, SPF and DKIM records to have proper email deliverability. We can also migrate your email from one system to another if you are looking to grow your supported features or migrate to save costs.</p>
</div><div class="service">
  <h2>IT Support</h2>
  <p><strong>We are dedicated to keeping your technology investment up and running smoothly so you can focus on your business.</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to your computers and network, you just want it to work. We can support many different computer systems; either physical or virtual, with a myriad of operating systems. Some examples include VMWare ESXi, Proxmox, Windows, Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, RHEL) and macOS. Services we provide to improve the lifecycle of your servers can include automation, installation, updates, patching, and monitoring and remote support.</p>
<p>We understand that when you enlist an IT company to handle your business objectives, you want them to be reliable and reputable. Whatever services we provide, you will have complete control and full access to all resources. We will never keep your property or data locked away from you.</p>
</div><div class="service">
  <h2>Networking</h2>
  <p><strong>Every network is unique and needs its own unique care.</strong></p>
<p>Knowing what's best for your network can be hard with so many connected devices that have their own individual requirements. We can recommend changes, fix trouble areas, or even overhaul entire segments.  You need a solid base to build your network on and we can install or support many network switches and routers. Security is not an afterthought. We can recommend firewall or VPN services to secure your network from prying eyes.</p>

</ul>
</div><div class="service">
  <h2>VoIP</h2>
  <p><strong>Seamless communication is an essential part of business.</strong></p>
<p>Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) can prove to be a valuable asset for businesses because it allows employees to make phone calls and video calling over the Internet. Implementing VoIP could save your company a lot of time and money, but the problem is that it's easy to poorly implement VoIP. We can fix these issues and give you a quality VoIP experience for you and your customers. Using a trusted cloud provider or local (link: https://www.freepbx.org text: FreePBX) installation, we can do custom operator panels and CDR reporting.</p>
