### Who Am I?

My name is Chris Carpenter. I am a husband and a father to a young son. I am a graduate of University of Northwestern Ohio with degrees in System Administration and Digital Multimedia Design. I have worked in several local businesses as a web developer, system administrator and network engineer. I have managed everything from websites and software applications to firewalls and operating systems. I've recently begun consulting with small businesses and companies on the side and find that it's very rewarding for both myself and my clients. I hope that I can work with you as well to meet your technology needs.
